This is the page describing Thomas Love's theatrical exploits.

## My Most Recent Show was in November 2019. No current plans.

I played Selsdon Mowbray in *Noises Off*, as presented by [the Hudson Players](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/) on November 1, 2, 8, 9, 10, 15 and 16, 2019. All performances at 8 PM except for a 2 PM matinee on Sunday November 10. Tickets [are available here](https://app.arts-people.com/index.php?actions=4&p=1).

Called "the funniest farce ever written," *Noises Off* presents a manic menagerie of itinerant actors rehearsing a flop called Nothing’s On in a precision timed, cunningly constructed, rip-roaringly hilarious comedy of epic proportions. With opening night just hours away, a motley company of actors stumbles through a frantic, final rehearsal of the British sex farce Nothing On, and things could not be going worse. Lines are forgotten, love triangles are unraveling, sardines are flying everywhere, and complete pandemonium ensues. Will the cast pull their act together on stage even if they can’t behind the scenes?

The play is directed by Brad Kisner, produced by Gary Maher & Trish Davis, and was written by Michael Frayn.

## If I'm a student/friend/neighbor/colleague of yours, are you expecting me to come see you in theater?

I'm always delighted to see anyone I know at any show I do. Please do come if you are interested. 

I also have various professional roles (as a teacher, for example) where I have some nominal control over other people's happiness or work. If you're someone who interacts with me professionally, please feel no obligation to attend a show I'm in. Attending (or not attending) a show I'm in carries **no** weight with me at all in any professional capacity.

## What Have I Seen You In?

Any one of a number of things. My [one-page theatrical resume is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater/blob/master/thomas_love_theatrical_resume_2019.pdf). 

- I'll add more details if that seems useful at some point in the future.
