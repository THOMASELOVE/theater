## Next Production: Sweeney Todd, September 28 - October 14, 2018

I will appear as Judge Turpin in **Sweeney Todd**, as performed at [the Brecksville Theatre](https://www.thebrecksvilletheatre.org/performances/891). The show features Mason Stewart as Sweeney, and Cindy Smith as Mrs. Lovett, and is directed by Mike Larochelle. Sweeney Todd is one of my all-time favorites, and one of Stephen Sondheim's master works. 

- Performances are on Friday and Saturday evenings, and Sunday afternoons, for three weeks, opening 2018 September 28 and closing 2018 October 14. 
- Tickets are $15 and available [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sweeney-todd-tickets-37253162211). 

*Sweeney Todd* is about vengeance and is one of the darker musicals ever written. Our production includes (stage) terror, blood and violence, and is thus not recommended for those who would be bothered by such things.

## What Have I Seen You In?

Any one of a number of things. My one-page theatrical resume is here.

## If I'm a student/friend/neighbor/colleague of yours, are you expecting me to come see you in theater?

I'm always delighted to see anyone I know at any show I do. Please do come if you are interested.

But please feel no obligation. Attending (or not attending) a show I'm in carries no weight with me at all in any professional capacity.
