This is the page describing Thomas Love's theatrical exploits.

## My next performances will be as Justice Wargrave in the play [And Then There Were None](https://www.auroracommunitytheatre.com/shows-1-1) at Aurora Community Theatre October 25 - November 16, 2024

"And Then There Were None" is one of Agatha Christie's most famous mysteries. The play begins when eight disparate guests arrive at an isolated mansion located on an island off the coast of Devon, and are tended to by two married domestics who prepared the house for their arrival. During the first evening a gramophone recording accuses all ten people of past crimes that went unpunished by the law. Soon they start dying one at a time, and the remaining guests deduce that the murderer is one of their own.

If you'd like to come, that would be great, and all of the information you need to buy tickets (they will **sell quickly**) is available by clicking the "Buy Tickets" link at <https://www.auroracommunitytheatre.com>. Tickets are $20. Performances are on Friday and Saturday evenings at 7:30 PM.

## If I'm a student/friend/neighbor/colleague of yours, are you expecting me to come see you in theater?

I'm always delighted to see anyone I know at any show I do. Please do come if you are interested, and comfortable being around people who are unmasked. 

I also have various professional roles (as a teacher, for example) where I have some nominal control over other people's happiness or work. If you're someone who interacts with me professionally, please feel no obligation to attend a show I'm in. Attending (or not attending) a show I'm in carries **no** weight with me at all in any professional capacity.

## What Have I Seen You In?

Any one of a number of things. My [one-page theatrical resume is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater/blob/master/thomas_love_theatrical_resume_2024.pdf).
