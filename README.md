### *A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum*

I am appearing as Miles Gloriosus in **A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum** at Aurora Community Theatre, beginning April 26 for ten performances at 8 PM Fridays and Saturdays through May 18, and also 3 PM Sundays May 5 and 12. I believe that *Forum* has a strong case to be considered the funniest musical ever written. Come see me sing, dance, strut, preen, boast, brag and behave foolishly, with an excellent cast, crew and band.

Aurora Community Theatre is located at 115 E. Pioneer Trail, near the intersection of SR 43 and 306, at the gazebo, in the center of Aurora, Ohio. Tickets for all shows are available online anytime, including seat selection, at https://auroracommunitytheatre.com/ or by calling 330-562-1818.

## If I'm a student/friend/neighbor/colleague of yours, are you expecting me to come see you in theater?

I'm always delighted to see anyone I know at any show I do. Please do come if you are interested. 

I also have various professional roles (as a teacher, for example) where I have some nominal control over other people's happiness or work. If you're someone who interacts with me professionally, please feel no obligation to attend a show I'm in. Attending (or not attending) a show I'm in carries **no** weight with me at all in any professional capacity.

## What Have I Seen You In?

Any one of a number of things. My [one-page theatrical resume is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater/blob/master/thomas_love_theatrical_resume_2018.pdf). 

- I'll add more details if that seems useful at some point in the future.

Witty, Irreverant Farce A FUNNY THING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO THE FORUM Opens April 26

The hysterical Broadway musical, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum, opens April 26 for ten performances at 8 pm Fridays and Saturdays through May 18 and 3 pm Sundays May 5 and 12 at Aurora Community Theatre, 115 E. Pioneer Trail.

The Tony award-winning Best Musical features music and lyrics by Stephen Sondheim with book by Burt Shevelove and Larry Gelbart. Quick-witted and fast-paced, A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum takes comedy back to its roots, combining age-old situations with the infectious energy of classic vaudeville.

Forum tells the story of the crafty slave, Pseudolus, who schemes to gain his freedom by winning the hand of the beautiful, but slightly obtuse courtesan, Philia, for his master, Hero.

Dave Stebbins directs Don Bernardo (Pseudolus), Jesse Roberts (Hero), Shelby Carlisle (Philia), and Thomas Love (Miles Gloriosus) in the plot full of twists, turns, mistaken identity, slamming doors and a showgirl or two.

Tim Shaffer is the music director with Amie W. Gabel, choreographer, and Marc C. Howard, producer, for this nonstop laugh-fest which also features Will C. Crosby (Hysterium), Brian Diehl (Senex), Karen Spiegler (Domina), Michael Guffey (Marcus Lycus), and Neil Rubin (Erronius)

Geneviève Adelman, Emily Fields, Katie Hintze, Diana Nabring, Alyssa Whiddon play the lovely courtesans, with proteans: Rollin DeVere III, Jeffrey Koudelka, Douglas R. Vanek.

Ann Nyenhuis is the stage manager/technical director with April Sike, assistant stage manager, Karen Cirino is in charge of costumes. Maggie Hamilton, designed the sound and Frankie Castrovillari, created the lighting.

Todd Plone designed the set, and Ann Nyenhuis led the construction crew which included: Joe Mira, Paul Mira, Ashley McCoy, Chris Hrach, Jerry Schaber, Craig McCloud, April Sike, Dave Nyenhuis, Linda Weinkamer, and Neil Rubin.

Craig Kollai serves as liaison to the ACT Board of Trustees. Marianne Gingras created the show image, and CPH Communications managed marketing and the box office.

Music director Shaffer will play the trumpet and conduct the orchestra featuring accompanist Dave Coxe on keyboard, David Betts, trombone, Josh Daum, percussion, Jonathan "Skip" Edwards, bass, with woodwinds performed by Ron Nelson, David Ciucevich and George Cyphers. Kristen Johnsten accompanied rehearsals.

A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum is presented through special arrangement with Music Theatre International (MTI). All authorized performance materials are also supplied by MTI. www.MTIShows.com.

## Previous Production: Sweeney Todd, September 28 - October 14, 2018

I appeared as Judge Turpin in **Sweeney Todd**, as performed at [the Brecksville Theatre](https://www.thebrecksvilletheatre.org/performances/891). The show featured Mason Stewart as Sweeney, and Cindy Smith as Mrs. Lovett, and was directed by Mike Larochelle. Sweeney Todd is one of my all-time favorite musicals, and one of Stephen Sondheim's master works. This was  my third production of the show (previously I've played the title character and The Beadle) and hopefully not my last.

- Performances are on Friday and Saturday evenings, and Sunday afternoons, for three weeks, opening 2018 September 28 and closing 2018 October 14. 
- Tickets are $15 and available [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sweeney-todd-tickets-37253162211). 

*Sweeney Todd* is about vengeance and is one of the darker musicals ever written. Our production includes (stage) terror, blood and violence, and is thus not recommended for those who would be bothered by such things.
