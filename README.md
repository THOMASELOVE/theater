This is the page describing Thomas Love's theatrical exploits.

## My next performance will be in "A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder" at Aurora Community Theatre in October/November 2021.

I'll be playing Chief Inspector Pinckney and various other small roles in this, the 2014 Tony Winning Best Musical. The performances are at 8 PM Fridays and Saturdays (and a couple of Sunday 2 PM matinees) from October 29 through November 20.

- Tickets are available through https://www.auroracommunitytheatre.com/. Aurora Community Theatre requires proof of vaccination or a negative Covid-19 test from within 72 hours of the performance date and time for entry. An image on your phone is acceptable. This precaution will be required of everyone entering the theatre. In addition masks also will be required inside the building, lobby, and all public spaces.

> When the low-born Monty Navarro discovers that he's eighth in line for an Earldom, he decides to better his odds of inheritance with a great deal of charm… and a dash of murder. But what about love? Perhaps there’s more to Monty’s maneuvers than just money on his path to becoming the ninth Earl of Highhurst.

## If I'm a student/friend/neighbor/colleague of yours, are you expecting me to come see you in theater?

I'm always delighted to see anyone I know at any show I do. Please do come if you are interested. 

I also have various professional roles (as a teacher, for example) where I have some nominal control over other people's happiness or work. If you're someone who interacts with me professionally, please feel no obligation to attend a show I'm in. Attending (or not attending) a show I'm in carries **no** weight with me at all in any professional capacity.

## What Have I Seen You In?

Any one of a number of things. My [one-page theatrical resume is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater/blob/master/thomas_love_theatrical_resume_2019.pdf).
