This is the page describing Thomas Love's theatrical exploits.

## Next Production? Sometime in 2019.

## Most recent Production: Sweeney Todd, September 28 - October 14, 2018

I will appear as Judge Turpin in **Sweeney Todd**, as performed at [the Brecksville Theatre](https://www.thebrecksvilletheatre.org/performances/891). The show features Mason Stewart as Sweeney, and Cindy Smith as Mrs. Lovett, and is directed by Mike Larochelle. Sweeney Todd is one of my all-time favorite musicals, and one of Stephen Sondheim's master works. This will be my third production of the show (previously I've played the title character and The Beadle) and hopefully not my last.

- Performances are on Friday and Saturday evenings, and Sunday afternoons, for three weeks, opening 2018 September 28 and closing 2018 October 14. 
- Tickets are $15 and available [here](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/sweeney-todd-tickets-37253162211). 

*Sweeney Todd* is about vengeance and is one of the darker musicals ever written. Our production includes (stage) terror, blood and violence, and is thus not recommended for those who would be bothered by such things.

## What Have I Seen You In?

Any one of a number of things. My [one-page theatrical resume is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater/blob/master/thomas_love_theatrical_resume_2018.pdf). 

- I'll add more details if that seems useful at some point in the future.

## If I'm a student/friend/neighbor/colleague of yours, are you expecting me to come see you in theater?

I'm always delighted to see anyone I know at any show I do. Please do come if you are interested. 

I also have various professional roles (as a teacher, for example) where I have some nominal control over other people's happiness or work. If you're someone who interacts with me professionally, please feel no obligation to attend a show I'm in. Attending (or not attending) a show I'm in carries **no** weight with me at all in any professional capacity.
