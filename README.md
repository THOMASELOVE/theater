This is the page describing Thomas Love's theatrical exploits.

## I'm going to be in a show this Friday and Saturday night. 

It is called "A Gentlemen's Guide to Love and Murder" at the [Chagrin Valley Little Theater](https://cvlt.org/events/gentlemans-guide/). I was in a production of this show last Fall, and am coming in now at the last moment to do two performances. I found this out last night, and will be working with one rehearsal, so we'll see how this goes. If you're interested, tickets are available at that link.

## My next scheduled performances will be as Brother Jeremiah in "Something Rotten" at [Hudson Players](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/something-rotten/)

While I've been cast in the show, and we've begun rehearsals, we are delayed by the pandemic for now. New dates will be announced in late Summer 2022.

## If I'm a student/friend/neighbor/colleague of yours, are you expecting me to come see you in theater?

I'm always delighted to see anyone I know at any show I do. Please do come if you are interested. 

I also have various professional roles (as a teacher, for example) where I have some nominal control over other people's happiness or work. If you're someone who interacts with me professionally, please feel no obligation to attend a show I'm in. Attending (or not attending) a show I'm in carries **no** weight with me at all in any professional capacity.

## What Have I Seen You In?

Any one of a number of things. My [one-page theatrical resume is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater/blob/master/thomas_love_theatrical_resume_2019.pdf).
