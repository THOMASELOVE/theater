This is the page describing Thomas Love's theatrical exploits.

## My next performances will be as Christopher Belling in the musical [Curtains](https://www.hudsonplayers.com/now-playing) at Hudson Players February 2-24, 2024.

"Curtains" is a harmonious fusion of Agatha Christie-esque mystery and the razzle-dazzle of golden-age musicals, and was nominated for eight Tony Awards when it opened in 2007, winning for Best Performance by a Leading Actor. The musical is a send-up of backstage murder mystery plots, set in 1959 Boston, Massachusetts, and follows the fallout when Jessica Cranshaw, the supremely untalented star of Robbin' Hood of the Old West is murdered during her opening night curtain call. I play the role of Christopher Belling, the English director of the musical-within-a-musical. Curtains' captivating score and cunning plot will keep you guessing until the final curtain falls. There are some adult themes in this production.

If you'd like to come, that would be great, and all of the information you need to buy tickets (they will **sell quickly**) is available by clicking the "Get Tickets" link at <https://www.hudsonplayers.com/>. Tickets are $15, and $12 for students and seniors. Performances are February 2, 3, 9, 10, 11, 16, 17, 18, 23 and 24, 2024. Friday and Saturday night shows begin at 8 PM, and the two Sunday matinees start at 2 PM.

## If I'm a student/friend/neighbor/colleague of yours, are you expecting me to come see you in theater?

I'm always delighted to see anyone I know at any show I do. Please do come if you are interested, and comfortable being around people who are unmasked. 

I also have various professional roles (as a teacher, for example) where I have some nominal control over other people's happiness or work. If you're someone who interacts with me professionally, please feel no obligation to attend a show I'm in. Attending (or not attending) a show I'm in carries **no** weight with me at all in any professional capacity.

## What Have I Seen You In?

Any one of a number of things. My [one-page theatrical resume is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater/blob/master/thomas_love_theatrical_resume_2024.pdf).
