This is the page describing Thomas Love's theatrical exploits.

## My next performances will be as Chris and Inspector Carter in The Play That Goes Wrong at [Aurora Community Theatre](https://www.auroracommunitytheatre.com/shows-1) January 27 - February 18, 2023

## If I'm a student/friend/neighbor/colleague of yours, are you expecting me to come see you in theater?

I'm always delighted to see anyone I know at any show I do. Please do come if you are interested, and comfortable being around people who are unmasked. 

I also have various professional roles (as a teacher, for example) where I have some nominal control over other people's happiness or work. If you're someone who interacts with me professionally, please feel no obligation to attend a show I'm in. Attending (or not attending) a show I'm in carries **no** weight with me at all in any professional capacity.

## What Have I Seen You In?

Any one of a number of things. My [one-page theatrical resume is here](https://github.com/THOMASELOVE/theater/blob/master/thomas_love_theatrical_resume_2019.pdf).
